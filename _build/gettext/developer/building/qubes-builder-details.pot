msgid ":doc:`QubesBuilder </developer/building/qubes-builder>` expects that each component have *Makefile.builder* file in its root directory. This file specifies what should be done to build the package. As name suggests, this is normal makefile, which is included by builder as its configuration. Its main purpose is to set some variables. Generally all available variables/settings are described as comments at the beginning of Makefile.* in :doc:`QubesBuilder </developer/building/qubes-builder>`."
