In some cases, the QCR and the PM will be the same person. For example, if someone contributes a package, then disappears, and no suitable replacement has been found, then it is likely that a core Qubes developer will play both the QCR and PM roles for that package, at least until another suitable candidate volunteers to become the PM for that package."
