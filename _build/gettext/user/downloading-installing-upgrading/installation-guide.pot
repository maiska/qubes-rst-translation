Without it, Qubes OS won’t be able to enforce isolation. For Intel-based boards, this setting is called Intel Virtualization for Directed I/O (**Intel VT-d**) and for AMD-based boards, it is called AMD I/O Virtualization Technology (or simply **AMD-Vi**). This parameter should be activated in your computer’s BIOS or UEFI, alongside the standard Virtualization (**Intel VT-x**) and AMD Virtualization (**AMD-V**) extensions. This `external guide <https://web.archive.org/web/20200112220913/https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/articles/000007139/server-products.html>`__ made for Intel-based boards can help you figure out how to enter your BIOS or UEFI to locate and activate those settings.
