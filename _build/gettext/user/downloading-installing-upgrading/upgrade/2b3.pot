msgid "Current Qubes R2 Beta 2 (R2B2) systems can be upgraded in-place to the latest R2 Beta 3 (R2B3) release by following the procedure below. However, upgrading in-place is riskier than performing a clean installation, since there are more things which can go wrong. For this reason, **we strongly recommended that users perform a** :doc:`clean installation </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/installation-guide>` **of Qubes R2 Beta 3**."
