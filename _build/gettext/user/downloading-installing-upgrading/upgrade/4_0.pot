Instead, we recommend using the templates that were created specifically for R4.0, which you can :doc:`customize </user/how-to-guides/how-to-install-software>` according to your needs. For the template OS versions supported in R4.0, see :ref:`supported releases <user/downloading-installing-upgrading/supported-releases:templates>`. If the restore tool complains about missing templates, you can select the option to restore the app qubes anyway, then change them afterward to use one of the default R4.0 templates."

msgid "One of differences between R3.2 and R4.0 is the handling of disposables. In R3.2, a disposable inherited its network settings (NetVM and firewall rules) from the calling qube. In R4.0, this is no longer the case. Instead, in R4.0 it’s possible to create multiple disposable templates and choose which one should be used by each qube. It’s even possible to use different disposable templates for different operations from the same qube. This allows much more flexibility, since it allows you to differentiate not only network settings, but all of a qube’s properties (including its template, memory settings, etc.)."

msgid "Restoring a backup from R3.2 preserves the old behavior by creating separate disposable template for each network-providing qube (and also ``disp-no-netvm`` for network-isolated qubes). Then, each restored qube is configured to use the appropriate disposable template according to its ``netvm`` or ``dispvm_netvm`` property from R3.2. This way, disposables started on R4.0 by qubes restored from a R3.2 backup have the same NetVM settings as they had on R3.2."

But, to do so, you must first make sure they are not set as the value for the ``default_dispvm`` property on any other qube. Both Qubes Manager and the ``qvm-remove`` tool will show you where a disposable template is being used, so you can go there and change the setting."
