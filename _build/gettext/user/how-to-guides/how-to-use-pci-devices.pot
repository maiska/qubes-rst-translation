msgid "**Warning:** Only dom0 exposes PCI devices. Some of them are strictly required in dom0 (e.g., the host bridge). You may end up with an unusable system by attaching the wrong PCI device to a VM. PCI passthrough should be safe by default, but non-default options may be required. Please make sure you carefully read and understand the :ref:`security considerations <user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security:pci security>` before deviating from default behavior."

msgid "Unlike other devices (:doc:`USB </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices>`, :doc:`block </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-block-storage-devices>`, mic), PCI devices need to be attached on VM-bootup. Similar to how you can’t attach a new sound-card after your computer booted (and expect it to work properly), attaching PCI devices to already booted VMs isn’t supported. Moreover, PCI devices can be attached only to VMs running in certain virtualization modes. See :ref:`FAQ: Which virtualization modes do VMs use? <introduction/faq:which virtualization modes do vms use?>`"

msgid "The Qubes installer attaches all network class controllers to ``sys-net`` and all USB controllers to ``sys-usb`` by default, if you chose to create the network and USB qube during install. While this covers most use cases, there are some occasions when you may want to manually attach one NIC to ``sys-net`` and another to a custom NetVM, or have some other type of PCI controller you want to manually attach."

Limits imposed by the PC and VT-d architectures may require all functions belonging to the same device to be attached to the same VM. This requirement can be dropped with the ``no-strict-reset`` option during attachment, bearing in mind the aforementioned :ref:`security considerations <user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security:pci security>`. In the steps below, you can tell if this is needed if you see the BDF for the same device listed multiple times with only the number after the “.” changing."

msgid "While PCI device can only be used by one powered on VM at a time, it *is* possible to *assign* the same device to more than one VM at a time. This means that you can use the device in one VM, shut that VM down, start up a different VM (to which the same device is now attached), then use the device in that VM. This can be useful if, for example, you have only one USB controller, but you have multiple security domains which all require the use of different USB devices."
