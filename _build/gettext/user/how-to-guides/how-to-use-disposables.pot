msgid "From inside an app qube, choosing the ``Open in disposable`` option on a file will launch a disposable for just that file. Changes made to a file opened in a disposable are passed back to the originating VM. This means that you can safely work with untrusted files without risk of compromising your other VMs. Disposables can be launched either directly from dom0’s Start Menu or terminal window, or from within app qubes. While running, disposables will appear in Qubes VM Manager with the name ``disp####``."

By default a disposable will inherit the NetVM and firewall settings of the disposable template on which it is based. This is a change in behaviour from R3.2, where disposables would inherit the settings of the app qube from which they were launched. Therefore, launching a disposable from an app qube will result in it using the network/firewall settings of the disposable template on which it is based. For example, if an app qube uses sys-net as its NetVM, but the default system disposable uses sys-whonix, any disposable launched from this app qube will have sys-whonix as its NetVM."

If the disposable template is its own default disposable template (as is often the case), this will result in a loop: ``qvm-open-in-dvm`` will execute ``qubes.OpenURL`` in a new disposable, but that will in turn execute ``qvm-open-in-dvm``.
