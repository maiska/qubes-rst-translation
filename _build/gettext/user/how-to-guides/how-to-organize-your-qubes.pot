msgid "When people first learn about Qubes OS, their initial reaction is often, “Wow, this looks really cool! But… what can I actually *do* with it?” It’s not always obvious which qubes you should create, what you should do in each one, and whether your organizational ideas makes sense from a security or usage perspective."

msgid "Each qube is essentially a secure compartment, and you can create as many of them as you like and connect them to each other in various ways. They’re sort of like Lego blocks in the sense that you can build whatever you want. But if you’re not sure what to build, then this open-ended freedom can be daunting. It’s a bit like staring at a blank document when you first sit down to write something. The possibilities are endless, and you may not know where to begin!"

msgid "The truth is that no one else can tell you *exactly* how you should organize your qubes, as there is no single correct answer to that question. It depends on your needs, desires, and preferences. Every user’s optimal setup will be different. However, what we *can* do is provide you with some illustrative examples based on questionnaires and interviews with Qubes users and developers, as well as our own personal experience and insight from using Qubes over the years. You may be able to adapt some of these examples to fit your own unique situation. More importantly, walking you through the rationale behind various decisions will teach you how to apply the same thought process to your own organizational decisions. Let’s begin!"

msgid "**Several qubes for writing code.** Here’s where she runs her IDE, commits code, and signs her commits. These qubes are based on different templates depending on which tools and which development environment she needs. In general, Alice likes to have a separate qube of this type for each client or each project. This allows her to keep everything organized and avoid accidentally mixing up any access credentials or client code, which could be disastrous. This also allows her to truthfully tell her clients that their code is always securely isolated from all her other clients. She likes to use the :doc:`Qubes firewall </user/security-in-qubes/firewall>` to restrict these qubes’ network access to only the code repositories she needs in that qube in order to avoid accidentally interacting with anything else on her local network or on the internet. Alice also has some qubes of this type for personal programming projects that she works on just for fun when she has “free time” (whatever that is)."

msgid "**Several qubes for building and testing.** Again, Alice usually likes to have one of these for each client or project in order to keep things organized. However, this can become rather cumbersome and memory-intensive when many such qubes are running at the same time, so Alice will sometimes use the same qube for building and testing, or for multiple projects that require the same environment, when she decides that the marginal benefits of extra compartmentalization aren’t worth the trouble. Here’s where she pulls any dependencies she needs, compiles her code, runs her build toolchain, and tests her deliverables. In some cases, she finds it useful to use :doc:`standalones </user/advanced-topics/standalones-and-hvms>` for these so that it’s easier to quickly :doc:`install different pieces of software </user/how-to-guides/how-to-install-software>` without having to juggle rebooting both the template and an app qube. She also sometimes finds it necessary (or just convenient) to make edits to config files in the root filesystem, and she’d rather not have to worry about losing those changes during an app qube reboot. She knows that she could use :doc:`bind-dirs </user/advanced-topics/bind-dirs>` to make those changes persistent, but sometimes she doesn’t want to get bogged down doing with all that and figures it wouldn’t be worth it just for this one qube. She’s secretly glad that Qubes OS doesn’t judge her this and just gives her the freedom to do things however she likes while keeping everything securely compartmentalized. At times like these, she takes comfort in knowing that things can be messy and disorganized *within* a qube while her overall digital life remains well-organized."

Likewise, she gives each qube access to her microphone while it’s needed, then removes access afterward. This way, she doesn’t have to trust any given video chat program’s mute button and doesn’t have to worry about being spied on when she’s not on a call. She also has a qube for social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News for networking and keeping up with new developments (or so she claims; in reality, it’s mostly for feuds over programming language superiority, Vim vs. Emacs wars, and tabs vs. spaces crusades)."

msgid "Carol works hard and lives below her means so that she can save money and invest it for her future. She hopes to become financially independent and maybe even retire early someday, and she’s decided that her best bet for achieving this is by investing for the long term and allow compounding to do its work. However, after doing some research into her country’s consumer financial protection laws, she learned that there’s no legal guarantee that customers will be made whole in the event of theft or fraud. The various insurance and protection organizations only guarantee recovery in the case of a financial institution *failing*, which is quite different from an individual customer being hacked. Moreover, even though many financial institutions have their own cybercrime policies, rarely, if ever, do they explicitly guarantee reimbursement in the event that a *customer* gets hacked (rather than the institution itself)."

msgid "Carol looked into how thieves might actually try to steal her hard-earned wealth and was surprised to learn that they have all sorts of ploys that she had never even considered. For example, she had assumed that any theft would, at the bare minimum, have to involve transferring money out of her account. That seems like a safe assumption. But then she read about “pump and dump” attacks, where thieves buy up some penny stock, hack into innocent people’s brokerage accounts, then use the victims’ funds to buy that same penny stock, “pumping” up its price so that the thieves can “dump” their shares on the market, leaving the victims with worthless shares. No money is ever transferred into or out of the victims’ account; it’s just used to buy and sell securities. So, all the safeguards preventing new bank accounts from being added or requiring extra approval for outbound transfers do nothing to protect victims’ funds in cases like these. And this is just one example! Carol realized that she couldn’t assume that existing safeguards against specific, known attacks were enough. She had to think about security at a more fundamental level and design it into her digital life from the ground up."

Sure, most people just use regular consumer tech and will probably end up fine, but, she reminded herself, most people also don’t have as much to lose. It’s not a risk that she was willing to take with her future, especially knowing that there’s probably no government bailout waiting for her and that all the brokerage firms’ vaguely reassuring marketing language about cybersecurity isn’t legally binding. So, Carol started reading more about computer security and eventually stumbled upon Qubes OS after searching the web for “most secure operating system.” She read about how it’s designed and why. Although she didn’t immediately understand all of the technical details, the fundamental principle of :doc:`security-by-compartmentalization </developer/system/architecture>` made intuitive sense to her, and the more she learned about the technical aspects, the more she realized that this is what she’d been looking for.

msgid "**One qube for all her credit card accounts.** Carol started to make a separate qube for each credit card account but ultimately decided against it. For one thing, the consumer protections for credit card fraud in her country are much better than for losing assets to theft or fraud in a bank or brokerage account, so the security risk isn’t as high. Second, there’s actually not a whole lot that an attacker could do with access to her credit cards’ online accounts or her old credit card statements, since online access to these generally doesn’t allow spending or withdrawing any money. So, even the worst case scenario here wouldn’t be catastrophic, unlike with her bank and brokerage accounts. Third, she’s not too worried about any of her credit card company websites being used to attach each other or her qube (As long as it’s contained to a single qube, she’s fine with that level of risk.) Last, but not least: She has way too many credit cards! While Carol is very frugal, she likes to collect the sign-up bonuses that are offered for opening new cards, so she’s accumulated quite a few of them. (However, she’s always careful to pay off her balance each month, so she never pays interest. She’s also pretty disciplined about only spending what she would have spent *anyway* and not being tempted to spend more just to meet a spending requirement or because she can.) At any rate, Carol has decided that the tiny benefit she stands to gain from having a separate qube for every credit card website wouldn’t be worth the hassle of having to manage so many extra qubes."

However, she finds the ability to self-custody a portion of her assets appealing from a long-term risk management perspective, particularly as a hedge against certain types of political risk."

You may find that your own needs overlap with more than one of them, in which case you may find it useful to model certain subsets of your overall Qubes system on different examples. You probably also noticed that there are commonalities among them. Most people need to use email, for example, so most people will need at least one email qube and a suitable template to base it on. But not everyone will need :doc:`Split GPG </user/security-in-qubes/split-gpg>`, and not everyone will want to use the same email client. On the other hand, almost everyone will need a password manager, and it pretty much always makes sense to keep it in an offline, network-isolated vault."

msgid ":doc:`Make frequent backups. </user/how-to-guides/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate>` Losing data is never fun, whether it’s from an accidental deletion, a system crash, buggy software, or a hardware failure. By getting into the habit of making frequent backups now, you’ll save yourself from a lot of pain in the future. Many people never take backups seriously until they suffer catastrophic data loss. That’s human nature. If you’ve experienced that before, then you know the pain. Resolve now never to let it happen again. If you’ve never experienced it, count yourself lucky and try to learn from the hard-won experience of others. Keeping good backups also allows you to be a bit more free with reorganizations. You can delete qubes that you think you won’t need anymore without having to worry that you might need them again someday, since you know you can always restore them from a backup."

msgid "**Think about which programs you want to run and where you want to store data.** In some cases, it makes sense to run programs and store data in the same qube, for example, if the data is generated by that program. In other cases, it makes sense to have qubes that are exclusively for storing data (e.g., offline data storage vaults) and other qubes that are exclusively for running programs (e.g., web browser-only qubes). Remember that when you make backups, it’s only essential to back up data that can’t be replaced. This can allow you to achieve minimal backups that are quite small compared to the total size of your installation. Templates, service qubes, and qubes that are used exclusively for running programs and that contain no data don’t necessarily have to be backed up as long as you’re confident that you can recreate them if needed. This is why it’s a good practice to keep notes on which packages you installed in which templates and which customizations and configurations you made. Then you can refer to your notes the next time you need to recreate those qubes. Of course, backing up everything is not a bad idea either. It may require a bit more time and disk space upfront, but for some people, it can be just as important as backing up their irreplaceable data. If your system is mission-critical, and you can’t afford more than a certain amount of downtime, then by all means, back everything up!"

msgid "**Introspect on your own behavior.** For example, if you find yourself wanting to find some way to get two qubes to share the same storage space, then this is probably a sign that those two qubes shouldn’t be separate in the first place. Sharing storage with each other largely breaks down the secure wall between them, making the separation somewhat pointless. But you probably had a good reason for wanting to make them two separate qubes instead of one to begin with. What exactly was that reason? If it has to do with security, then why are you okay with them freely sharing data that could allow one to infect the other? If you’re sure sharing the data wouldn’t cause one to infect the other, then what’s the security rationale for keeping them separate? By critically examining your own thought process in this way, you can uncover inconsistencies and contradictions that allow you to better refine your system, resulting in a more logical organization that serves your needs better and better over time."

After all, most people don’t think that using a conventional monolithic operating system is risky, when in reality their entire digital life can be taken down in one fell swoop. That’s why a good rule of thumb is: When in doubt, compartmentalize."

Your extra self-imposed security measures are interfering with the very thing they’re designed to protect. At times like these, take a deep breath and remember that you’ve already reaped the vast majority of the security benefit simply by using Qubes OS in the first place and performing basic compartmentalization (e.g., no random web browsing in templates). Each further step of hardening and compartmentalization beyond that represents an incremental gain with diminishing marginal utility. Try not to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good!"
