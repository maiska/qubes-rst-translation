If you wish to send your backup to a :doc:`USB mass storage device </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices>`, you can use the directory selection widget to mount a connected device (under “Other locations” item on the left); or first mount the device in a VM, then select the mount point inside that VM as the backup destination. You must also specify a directory on the device or in the VM, or a command to be executed in the VM as a destination for your backup. For example, if you wish to send your backup to the ``~/backups`` folder in the target VM, you would simply browse to it using the convenient directory selection dialog (``...``) at the right. This destination directory must already exist. If it does not exist, you must create it manually prior to backing up. By specifying the appropriate directory as the destination in a VM, it is possible to send the backup directly to, e.g., a USB mass storage device attached to the VM. Likewise, it is possible to enter any command as a backup target by specifying the command as the destination in the VM. This can be used to send your backup directly to, e.g., a remote server using SSH. **Note:** The supplied passphrase is used for **both** encryption/decryption and integrity verification. At this point, you may also choose whether to save your settings by checking or unchecking the **Save settings as default backup profile** box. **Warning: Saving the settings will result in your backup passphrase being saved in plaintext in dom0, so consider your threat model before checking this box.**"

If the contents from the dom0 backup were instead to overwrite the existing files in dom0’s home directory, unexpected and undesired configuration changes could occur. However, if you do wish to move all files from the dom0 backup out of the subdirectory into your current dom0 home directory (overwriting any existing files in the process), you may do so by following the instructions `here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20192070/how-to-move-all-files-including-hidden-files-into-parent-directory-via>`__.
