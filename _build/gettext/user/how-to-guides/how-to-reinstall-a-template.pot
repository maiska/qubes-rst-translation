msgid "Note that Qubes may initially refuse to perform the reinstall if the exact revision of the template package on your system is no longer in the Qubes online repository. In this case, you can specify ``upgrade`` as the action instead and the newer version will be used. The other ``dnf`` package actions that are supported in addition to ``reinstall`` and ``upgrade`` are ``upgrade-to`` and ``downgrade``. Note that the ``upgrade``, ``upgrade-to``, and ``downgrade`` commands are only supported under Fedora based UpdateVMs. If you receive a message about them being unsupported, review the manual reinstallation method below."
