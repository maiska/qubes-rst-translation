msgid "Qubes OS is effectively a “meta” operating system (OS) that can run almost any arbitrary OS inside of itself. For example, the way software is normally installed in a Linux distribution (“distro”) is quite different from the way software is normally installed in Windows. This isn’t up to Qubes. Qubes is just the framework in which you’re running these other OSes. Therefore, if you want to install software in a Linux template, for example, you should do so in whatever way is normal for that Linux distro. Most Linux software is distributed via `packages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_format>`__, which are stored in `software repositories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository>`__ (“repos”). `Package managers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager>`__ handle downloading, installing, updating, and removing packages. (Again, none of this is Qubes-specific.) If you’re not familiar with how software is normally installed in Linux distros via package managers or the software you want doesn’t seem to be available in your distro’s repos (or you’re in another situation not covered on this page), please read this `community guide to installing software in Qubes <https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/9991/>`__."
