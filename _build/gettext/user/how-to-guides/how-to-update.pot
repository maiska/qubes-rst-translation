msgid "Security updates are an extremely important part of keeping your Qubes installation secure. When there is an important security issue, we will issue a `Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB) <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/qsb/>`__ via the :title-reference:`Qubes Security Pack (``qubes-secpack``) </security/pack/>`__. It is very important to read each new QSB and follow any user instructions it contains. Most of the time, simply `updating your system normally <#routine-updates>`__ will be sufficient to obtain security updates. However, in some cases, special action may be required on your part, which will be explained in the QSB."
