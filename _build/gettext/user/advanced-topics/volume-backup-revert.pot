msgid "With Qubes, it is possible to revert one of a VM’s storage volumes to a previous state using the automatic snapshot that is normally saved every time a VM is shutdown. (Note that this is a different, lower level activity than the :doc:`Backup, Restoration, and Migration </user/how-to-guides/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate>` process.)"

msgid "In Qubes, when you create a new VM, it’s volumes are stored in one of the system’s :doc:`Storage Pools </user/advanced-topics/secondary-storage>`. On pool creation, a revisions_to_keep default value is set for the entire pool. (For a pool creation example, see :doc:`Storing app qubes on Secondary Drives </user/advanced-topics/secondary-storage>`.) Thereafter, each volume associated with a VM that is stored in this pool inherits the pool default revisions_to_keep."

msgid "The output of the above command will also display the “Available revisions (for revert)” at the bottom. For a very large volume in a small pool, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to the minimum value of 1 to minimize the possibility of the pool being accidentally filled up by snapshots. For a smaller volume for which you would like to have the future option of reverting, revisions_to_keep should probably be set to at least 2. To set revisions_to_keep for this same VM / volume example:"
