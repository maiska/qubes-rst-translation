msgid "By default Qubes uses thin volumes for the disk images. This means that space is not actually allocated for the volume until it is used. So a 2GB private volume with 100M of files will only use 100M. This explains how you can have *many* qubes with large private volumes on quite a small disk. This is called over provisioning. You should keep an eye on the disk-space widget to see how much free space you actually have."

msgid "There are several disk images which can be easily extended, but pay attention to the overall consumed space of your sparse/thin disk images. In most cases, the GUI tool Qube Settings (available for every qube from the Start menu, and also in the Qube Manager) will allow you to easily increase maximum disk image size."

msgid "In case of standalone qubes and templates, just change the Disk Storage settings above. In case of template-based qubes, the private storage (the /home directory and user files) can be changed in the qube’s own settings, but the system root image is :doc:`inherited from the template </introduction/getting-started>`, and so it must be changed in the template settings. If you are increasing the disk image size for Linux-based qubes installed from Qubes OS repositories in Qubes 4.0 or later, changing the settings above is all you need to do - in other cases, you may need to do more, according to instructions below. See also the OS-specific follow-up instructions below."
