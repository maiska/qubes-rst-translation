msgid "In this section, we describe how to setup ``GuiVM`` in several case as described in `GUI Domain <https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2020/03/18/gui-domain/>`__. In all the cases, the base underlying TemplateVM used is ``Fedora`` with ``XFCE`` flavor to match current desktop choice in ``dom0``. That can be adapted very easily for other desktops and templates. By default, the configured ``GuiVM`` is a management qube with global admin permissions ``rwx`` but can be adjusted to ``ro`` (see `Introducing the Qubes Admin API <https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2017/06/27/qubes-admin-api/>`__) in pillar data of the corresponding ``GuiVM`` to setup. For example, pillar data for ``sys-gui`` located at ``/srv/pillar/base/qvm/sys-gui.sls``. Please note that each ``GuiVM`` has no ``NetVM``."

In order to reach the ``VNC`` server, we encourage to not connect ``sys-gui-vnc`` to a ``NetVM`` but rather to use another qube for remote access, say ``sys-remote``. First, you need to bind port 5900 of ``sys-gui-vnc`` into a ``sys-remote`` local port (you may want to use another port than 5900 to reach ``sys-remote`` from the outside). For that, use ``qubes.ConnectTCP`` RPC service (see :doc:`Firewall </user/security-in-qubes/firewall>`. Then, you can use any ``VNC`` client to connect to you ``sys-remote`` on the chosen local port (5900 if you kept the default one). For the first connection, you will reach ``lightdm`` for which you can log as ``user`` where ``user`` refers to the first ``dom0`` user in ``qubes`` group and with corresponding ``dom0`` password."

Generally, if this ``VNC`` server is exposed to open network, it must be protected with some other (cryptographic) layer like ``VPN``. The setup as is, is useful only for purely testing machine."
