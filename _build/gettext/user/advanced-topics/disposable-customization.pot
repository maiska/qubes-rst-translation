msgid "If a disposable template becomes compromised, then any disposable based on that disposable template could be compromised. Therefore, you should not make any risky customizations (e.g., installing untrusted browser plugins) in important disposable templates. In particular, the *default* disposable template is important because it is used by the “Open in disposable” feature. This means that it will have access to everything that you open with this feature. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you base the default disposable template on a trusted template and refrain from making any risky customizations to it."
