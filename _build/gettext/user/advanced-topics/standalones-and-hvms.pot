Unlike templates, however, standalones do not supply their root filesystems to other qubes. Examples of situations in which standalones can be useful include:"

However, when you would like to install some packages from less trusted sources, or unsigned, then using a dedicated (untrusted) standalone might be a better way."

In practice, however, it is most common for standalones to be HVMs and for HVMs to be standalones. Hence, this page covers both topics."
