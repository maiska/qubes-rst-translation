msgid "These steps assume you have already created a separate `volume group <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/vg_admin#VG_create>`__ and `thin pool <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/logical_volume_manager_administration/thinly_provisioned_volume_creation>`__ (not thin volume) for your HDD. See also `this example <https://www.linux.com/blog/how-full-encrypt-your-linux-system-lvm-luks>`__ if you would like to create an encrypted LVM pool (but note you can use a single logical volume if preferred, and to use the ``-T`` option on ``lvcreate`` to specify it is thin). You can find the commands for this example applied to Qubes at the bottom of this R4.0 section."
