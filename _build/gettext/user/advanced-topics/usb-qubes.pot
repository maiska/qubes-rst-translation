msgid "A USB qube acts as a secure handler for potentially malicious USB devices, preventing them from coming into contact with dom0 (which could otherwise be fatal to the security of the whole system). It thereby mitigates some of the :ref:`security risks of using USB devices <user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security:usb security>`. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend carefully reading the :ref:`security warning on USB input devices <user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security:security warning on usb input devices>` before proceeding."

msgid "If you use a USB keyboard, there is a high risk of locking yourself out of your system when experimenting with USB qubes. For example, if a USB qube takes over your sole USB controller (to which your USB keyboard is connected), then your keyboard will no longer be able to control dom0. This will prevent you from performing many essential tasks, such as entering your decryption and login passphrases, rendering your system unusable until you reinstall. This section covers various options for addressing this problem."

Moreover, while most laptops use PS/2 connections for the keyboard internally, some use USB. (Check yours by examining the output of the ``lsusb`` command.) If you have a PS/2 port but still wish to use a USB keyboard, then having a backup PS/2 keyboard handy can be useful in case you accidentally lock yourself out of your system."
