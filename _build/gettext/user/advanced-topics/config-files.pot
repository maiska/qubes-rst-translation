For each script, the ``command``, ``vif``, ``vif_type`` and ``ip`` is passed as arguments (see ``/etc/xen/scripts/vif-route-qubes``). For example, consider a PV app qube ``work`` with IP ``10.137.0.100`` and ``sys-firewall`` as NetVM. Assuming it’s Xen domain id is arbitrary ``12`` then, the following script located at ``/rw/config/network-hooks.d/hook-100.sh`` in ``sys-firewall``:"

Please note that in case of an HVM, the script will be called twice - once with vif_type ``vif``, then with vif_type ``vif_ioemu`` (and different interface names). As long as the ioemu interface exists, it should be preferred (up to the hook script). When the VM decides to use a PV interface (vif_type ``vif``), the ioemu one will be unplugged."
