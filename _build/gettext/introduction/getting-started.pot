msgid "Qubes OS is an operating system built out of securely-isolated compartments called :ref:`qubes <user/reference/glossary:qube>`. For example, you might have a work qube, a personal qube, a banking qube, a web browsing qube, and so on. You can have as many qubes as you want! Most of the time, you’ll be using an :ref:`app qube <user/reference/glossary:app qube>`, which is a qube intended for running software programs like web browsers, email clients, and word processors. Each app qube is based on another type of qube called a :ref:`template <user/reference/glossary:template>`. More than one qube can be based on the same template. Importantly, a qube cannot modify its template in any way. This means that, if a qube is ever compromised, its template and any other qubes based on that template will remain safe. This is what makes Qubes OS so secure. Even if an attack is successful, the damage is limited to a single qube."

msgid "Suppose you want to use your favorite web browser in several different qubes. You’d install the web browser in a template, then every qube based on that template would be able to run the web browser software (while still being forbidden from modifying the template and any other qubes). This way, you only have to install the web browser a single time, and updating the template serves to update all the qubes based on it. This elegant design saves time and space while enhancing security."

msgid "There are also some “helper” qubes in your system. Each qube that connects to the Internet does so through a network-providing :ref:`service qube <user/reference/glossary:service qube>`. If you need to access USB devices, another service qube will do that. There’s also a :ref:`management qube <user/reference/glossary:management qube>` that automatically handles a lot of background housekeeping. For the most part, you won’t have to worry about it, but it’s nice to know that it’s there. As with app qubes, service qubes and management qubes are also based on templates. Templates are usually named after their operating system (often a `Linux distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>`__) and corresponding version number. There are many ready-to-use :doc:`templates </user/templates/templates>` to choose from, and you can download and have as many as you like."

msgid "Last but not least, there’s a very special :ref:`admin qube <user/reference/glossary:admin qube>` which, as the name suggests, is used to administer your entire system. There’s only one admin qube, and it’s called :ref:`dom0 <user/reference/glossary:dom0>`. You can think of it as the master qube, holding ultimate power over everything that happens in Qubes OS. Dom0 is more trusted than any other qube. If dom0 were ever compromised, it would be “game over.” The entire system would effectively be compromised. That’s why everything in Qubes OS is specifically designed to protect dom0 and ensure that doesn’t happen. Due to its overarching importance, dom0 has no network connectivity and is used only for running the `desktop environment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment>`__ and `window manager <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager>`__. Dom0 should never be used for anything else. In particular, you should never run user applications in dom0. (That’s what your app qubes are for!)"

msgid "You’ll choose a **color** for each of your qubes out of a predefined set of colors. Each window on your desktop will have its frame colored according to the color of that qube. These colored frames help you keep track of which qube each window belongs to and how trustworthy it is. This is especially helpful when you have the same app running in multiple qubes at the same time. For example, if you’re logged in to your bank account in one qube while doing some random web surfing in a different qube, you wouldn’t want to accidentally enter your banking password in the latter! The colored frames help to avoid such mistakes."

msgid "Most Qubes users associate red with what’s untrusted and dangerous (like a red light: stop! danger!), green with what’s safe and trusted, and yellow and orange with things in the middle. This color scheme also extends to include blue and black, which are usually interpreted as indicating progressively more trusted domains than green, with black being ultimately trusted. Color and associated meanings are ultimately up to you, however. The system itself does not treat the colors differently. If you create two identical qubes — black and red, say — they’ll be the same until you start using them differently. Feel free to use the colors in whatever way is most useful to you. For example, you might decide to use three or four qubes for work activities and give them all the same color — or all different colors. It’s entirely up to you."
