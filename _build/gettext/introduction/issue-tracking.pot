If you so choose, you can test the fix while it’s in the :doc:`testing </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/testing>` repository, or you can wait for it to land in the stable repository. If, after testing the fix, you find that it does not really fix the reported bug, please leave a comment on the issue explaining the situation. When you do, we will receive a notification and respond on the issue or reopen it (or both). Please **do not** create a duplicate issue or attempt to contact the developers individually about a problem."

Each of these labels has a description that explains the label. We’ll also leave a comment explaining why we’re closing the issue with one of these specific resolutions. If the issue is closed without one of these specific resolutions, then it means, by default, that the reported bug was fixed or the requested enhancement was implemented."
